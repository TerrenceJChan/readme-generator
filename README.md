## Installation
Download the file from GitHub. Make sure your system has the latest version of Node installed. Open the file in your terminal, and use npm i to install the dependencies that this program needs.
## Usage
Run the program by using node index.js in the folder directory. Answer each prompt. A README.md file will be generated in the output folder, ready to be used!

Please note that the program will link to your GitHub repository. To find your GitHub username, go to your profile page, and it will be the text underneath your name.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! I am very active and monitor new pull requests on a regular basis.
## Tests
Since this program generates a README file based on the user's input, the only way that the outcome is satisfactory is for the user to be vigilant in answering the prompts. There is a sample README file that is in the output folder that comes with the initial download of this program. Please contact me if any issues arise from using this program.
