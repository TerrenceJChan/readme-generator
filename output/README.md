## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! I am very active and monitor new pull requests on a regular basis.
## Tests
Since this program generates a README file based on the user's input, the only way that the outcome is satisfactory is for the user to be vigilant in answering the prompts. Please contact me if any issues arise from using this program.
